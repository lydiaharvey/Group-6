## What do you propose?

We will be developing a mobile geo location photo guesser application. This allows users to interact with the real world by bridging the gap between physical and augmented reality. 

## Why is there a need for this system? 

We allow customers to immerse themselves in a different environment. Allowing them to interact with one another in a natural setting. This encourages them to interact with their surroundings in a unique way.

## How will your system work?

We will be developing a mobile application. 
- It will be a location based game where you can connect to your friends and share photos to each other. 
- There will be other game elements like a leaderboard and a point system.
- There will be a map displaying all the users' pictures pinned at the location they were taken. 
- There will also be an account based system so the user has to log in.
- Allow the consumers to interact with other users on the app and rate/comment on pictures uploaded.
