## What system will you be developing?

We will be developing a mobile application. 
It will be a location based game where you can connect to your friends and share photos to each other. 
There will be other game elements like a leaderboard and a point system.
There will be a map displaying all the users' pictures pinned at the location they were taken. 
There will also be an account based system so the user has to log in.

## Who is your target audience?

Our target audience will be users who use social media frequently and  communicate with their friends on a daily basis. There is a large target audience, particularly of young adults who document their lives online regularly
