# Coursework 2.1 - Problem specification 


## Overview

“Where am I” is a mobile based app which, fundamentally, acts as a social- gaming platform. The app allows users to post a picture of their location and gives their connected friends an opportunity to guess their location. This allows users to interact with the real world by bridging the gap between physical and augmented reality. As technology advances at a rapid pace, there is a constant need to update and deliver content in a new innovative direction.

We allow customers to immerse themselves in a different environment. Allowing them to interact with one another in a natural setting. This encourages them to interact with their surroundings in a unique way. 

## Introduction 

Further explanations of key aspects of the project development cycle, exploring the main requirements of the application is a key step in the development as it details what is required by the system will be explored within this document??? As a business,we will be evaluating every stage in detail which are; design, development, testing to ensure our application will be fully functional and meet its target audience.

To accurately implement the required system, user feedback will be gathered via an anonymous form to thoroughly evaluate the users needs and requirements to assist in the development of the application.


## Requirement Research

In this chapter, we'll look at the functional and non-functional system requirements of 'Where Am I,' by using requirement elicitation and analysis. By using elicitation we are able to choose specific demographics and target them to derive the systems requirements, design, development, testing and evaluation of the project.

For the elicitation of the user requirements, we used surveys to gather information, as we felt it was the most appropriate method to collect data for our application. We decided on a target audience according to web based research that showed people aged 18-29 used social media the most out of any other demographic. As large as 84% of that demographic use at least one social networking site, making them a perfect target audience for our social application. 

However, in order to be inclusive, we distributed the study survey to a broad array of individuals in order to collect as much knowledge as we could. We collected evidence from 3 types of groups. The initial phase concentrated on students at Portsmouth University. The second stage concentrated on female applicants who were all connected via a Whatsapp group due to shared interests. The third phase was a social media posting with the survey link attached. The interactions between a few people are shown below, along with observations and comparisons of the platforms they use currently.

## Functional Requirements

We are using a ranking system with the attached level of necessity priority scorecard to rate each requirement by status and value. This allows us to assess whether a particular requirement is critical to the project's success.

| REQUIRMENTS  | LEVEL OF NECCESITY | PRIORITY | DESCRIPTION |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|The application store the user’s location in a database| MUST HAVE | 1 | The application will have a dedicated storage sector which is used for storing the user's picture location from the moment it's taken (permission requested) and have it displayed on the interactable map.The system will present to the user a permission request to save this data. |
| The application can display the users location on a map | MUST HAVE | 2 | The application enables the incorporation of maps into applications. It ensures that you can detect and display the user's location using geolocation functions and trackers.|
| The application allows the user to take a picture using the front and back camera and store it in a database | MUST HAVE | 3 | The application will request permission to use the device camera of the user, it will then declare the use of camera features. The application will then save the images to an external storage. |
| The application displays the users picture | MUST HAVE | 4 | As the app allows you to post a picture daily, it is necessary to have a store of all the pictures which have been posted. This will give the user the choice to view any picture they have uploaded. |
| The application sends the user a notification at a random time between 9am - 10pm prompting the user to take a picture | MUST HAVE | 5 | The application will send a “push notification” to the users device prompting them upon opening the app to take a picture of the surrounding area and uploading it to the apps database to be displayed on the users profile.The push notification has a set time range for the prompt to go off, which will allow various images to be taken between the time ranges of 9am and 10pm allowing for a wide variety of locations to be captured. |
| The user can edit a profile by adding a profile picture | SHOULD HAVE | 6 | It should be simple to add and remove profile images. To publish an image, there should be a simple step by step procedure. Furthermore, they should be easily removable if the user decides they no longer want one or wish to alter the image to a different one.|
| The user can create a username and password for their account | SHOULD HAVE | 7 | Allowing the user to set up an account with secure login information will ensure all their data is kept behind a secure wall and allows only them to access their private information. |
| The user can search for their friends usernames and add them as a friend | SHOULD HAVE | 8 | The user should be able to type friends usernames and see the option to add them as a friend |
| Friends pictures are displayed in a feed | SHOULD HAVE | 9 | The system should include a news feed with photo updates from friends with whom the user has linked |
| When a friends picture is selected, a map should be displayed and the user should be allowed to pin a location on the map | SHOULD HAVE | 10 | As a core aim of the app is to allow the user’s friends to pinpoint where the user is, the connected friends will be shown a map which they will need to pin a certain location on to.  |
| Each user has an amount of points stored in the database | SHOULD HAVE | 11 | Each user is allowed to guess up to three times, increasing based on how close the user is away from the pinpoint location which is then tallied on the leaderboard everyday and displayed for others to view. |
| The users points should be displayed under their name | SHOULD HAVE | 12 | A rating system and review feature should be available on each account. Each user should have a star rating per picture uploaded daily. This will be stored alongside the applicant's username. Allowing friends to see rankings from previous days. |
| If the user pins a location within a 50 metre radius of where their friends photo was taken there points increase by 100 | COULD HAVE | 13 | In order to make the application more competitive, while the user has to pin the location, the user will be given a chance to pin a more accurate location in order to achieve more points.  |
| A leaderboard is displayed in the application comparing the users points with their friends. | COULD HAVE | 14 | Once the cut-off time is reached, all users points obtained from guessing location of the picture will be tallied up and display a UI containing a ranking system between users and friends so they can compare to one another. The leaderboard system will be limited to the top 10 friends at a time.|
| Users can add comments under their friends photos | COULD HAVE | 15 | When a user's friends share an image, the programme will send a "push notice" to their device. Once the image has been uploaded, people who are friends with each other can comment on each other's daily updates. After receiving a comment, the user will be notified and will be able to respond to their friend's comment. |
  

## Functional Requirements Analysis 

1. Everyone will have free access to the system. This should allow people to view the system without the need to create an account. Unfortunately, there will be restrictions, thus making an account is advised. Anyone who has trouble using the website should be able to contact assistance for support. We will test this by browsing the website from mobile devices, PCs with various operating systems, and so on.

2. Users may use various devices, therefore the website must be accessible on any device at any time. 

3. Users who access the system will have visibility to their friends' posts, but only from that day / time period. They will be unable to view previous posts. Furthermore, friends will only be able to read posts from users with whom they are engaged with 

4. Upon logging into the user's account, the security system will instantly launch and offer the user with authentication, and a code will be sent via email, phone, or SMS, to validate the user. This should keep unauthorised users from accessing accounts. To determine if our security system is enough, we will use brute force to obtain access to an account and observe if the user authentication appears to prevent access.

5. Users will need an account to access their personal information,  messages, friend requests, photos and the location in where the image was taken. Any received updates will be communicated via a notification system. We will verify this by creating our own accounts on the application and then exploring all of the features to ensure that everything works as expected.

6. Users viewing the system will have access to all of the photos that their friends have shared, with the exception of the place in which the photo was captured. Which they will have to guess based on the hints and the image itself. All connected users will be able to see eachothers images; discussions will be held via a personal messaging system.

## Non Functional Requirements 

| NON- FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS  | MEASURABLE |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| COMPATIBILITY & PORTABILITY  | The revolution of mobile devices and technology means that the design of applications has advanced rapidly. This is due to the different screen sizes, hardware, desktop resolution and orientation of the device. Flutter allows you to create apps that self-adapt to the device's at hand. The application will use responsive UI development techniques. To ensure that this requirement is complete we will open the application on different devices including computers, laptops, phones, tablets, etc. |
| COMPLIANCE  | In the production of an application a set of rules need to be set, in this application we will be monitoring and regulating the use of the users data and privacy and ensuring all users are protected under the relevant laws that we have to follow as an organisation. With exceptional use of a compliance sector in place, this allows us to stop data breaches and help with data protection.|
| USABILITY |By creating a consumer-tailored interface, the programme will have a user interface that truly meets the demands of the users. We will enable users to explore the application relatively quickly by simplifying digital interaction. To validate the user interface, we will conduct tests with students outside our groups, but in our demographic. We will collect comments in order to improve our platform.|
| SECURITY |As a business, we must organise and classify data correctly. By weighing the risks related to the user inputs, this enables the applications to safeguard sensitive data. When users post a picture, we will ensure that only the necessary information is stored alongside it. For example the clues, answers and exact location of the picture. Not the user's personal information such as username, password or address. This allows sensitive data to be treated confidentially and not displayed publicly on the mobile application. Making the software resilient in the face of attacks. |
| MAINTAINABILITY |  The system should be capable of being easily maintainable so that the costs are manageable and the ability to easily modify its contents so that systems can be modified at any given notice to accommodate for any bug fixes. |
| LOCALISAZTION | The ability of a system to adjust to various languages.. This may entail localising the system to cater to the distinct needs and tastes of users in various locations, as well as translating the user interface and system information into various languages. Localization is crucial for making a system accessible and user-friendly for a worldwide audience and can also enhance the overall user experience. |
